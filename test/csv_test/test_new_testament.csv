66,3,11,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
67,3,12,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
68,3,13,"And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

76,3,21,"And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
77,3,22,"And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-",ASV,Gen,Genesis
78,3,23,"therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
79,3,24,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

89,4,10,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
90,4,11,"And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
91,4,12,"when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

829,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

865,30,35,"And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
866,30,36,and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
867,30,37,"And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
868,30,38,And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
869,30,39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
870,30,40,"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban's flock.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
871,30,41,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
872,30,42,"but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
873,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
874,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
875,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
876,31,3,"And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

878,31,5,"and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
879,31,6,And ye know that will all my power I have served your father.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
880,31,7,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
881,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
882,31,9,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
883,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
884,31,11,"And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
885,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
886,31,13,"I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
887,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
888,31,15,"Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
889,31,16,"For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
890,31,17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
891,31,18,"and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
892,31,19,Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
893,31,20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
894,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
895,31,22,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
896,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
897,31,24,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
898,31,25,And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
899,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
900,31,27,"Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
901,31,28,and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
902,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
903,31,30,"And now, [though] thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
904,31,31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
905,31,32,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
906,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
907,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
908,31,35,"And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
909,31,36,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
910,31,37,"Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
911,31,38,"These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
912,31,39,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
913,31,40,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
914,31,41,"These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
915,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
916,31,43,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
917,31,44,"And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
918,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
919,31,46,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
920,31,47,And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
921,31,48,"And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
922,31,49,"and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
923,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
924,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
925,31,52,"This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
926,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
927,31,54,"And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
928,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned unto his place.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
929,32,1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
930,32,2,"And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
931,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
932,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
933,32,5,"and I have oxen, and asses, [and] flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
934,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
935,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
936,32,8,"and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
937,32,9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
938,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
939,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
940,32,12,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
941,32,13,"And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
942,32,14,"two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,",ASV,Gen,Genesis
943,32,15,"thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
944,32,16,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
945,32,17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
946,32,18,"then thou shalt say [They are] thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
947,32,19,"And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
948,32,20,"and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
949,32,21,So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
950,32,22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
951,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
952,32,24,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
953,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
954,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
955,32,27,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
956,32,28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
957,32,29,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
958,32,30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, [said he], I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
959,32,31,"And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
960,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
961,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
962,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
963,33,3,"And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
964,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
965,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
966,33,6,"Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
967,33,7,"And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
968,33,8,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
969,33,9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
970,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
971,33,11,"Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
972,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
973,33,13,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
974,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
975,33,15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
976,33,16,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
977,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
978,33,18,"And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
979,33,19,"And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
980,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
981,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
982,34,2,"And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
983,34,3,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
984,34,4,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
985,34,5,Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
986,34,6,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
987,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
988,34,8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

1155,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught [that was] with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

1180,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1181,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1182,40,10,"and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, [and] its blossoms shot forth; [and] the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1183,40,11,"and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1184,40,12,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1185,40,13,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

1187,40,15,for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1188,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1189,40,17,and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1190,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1191,40,19,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1192,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1193,40,21,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1194,40,22,but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1195,40,23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1196,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1197,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1198,41,3,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1199,41,4,And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1200,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1201,41,6,"And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1202,41,7,"And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1203,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1204,41,9,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1205,41,10,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1206,41,11,"and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1207,41,12,"And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1208,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1209,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1210,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1211,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1212,41,17,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1213,41,18,"and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1214,41,19,"and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1215,41,20,and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1216,41,21,"and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1217,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1218,41,23,"and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1219,41,24,and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1220,41,25,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1221,41,26,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1222,41,27,"And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1223,41,28,That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1224,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1225,41,30,and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1226,41,31,and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1227,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1228,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1229,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1230,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1231,41,36,"And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1232,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1233,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1234,41,39,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1235,41,40,"thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1236,41,41,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1237,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1238,41,43,"and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1239,41,44,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1240,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1241,41,46,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1242,41,47,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1243,41,48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1244,41,49,"And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1245,41,50,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1246,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, [said he], God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1247,41,52,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1248,41,53,"And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1249,41,54,"And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1250,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1251,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1252,41,57,"And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1253,42,1,"Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1254,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1255,42,3,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1256,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1257,42,5,And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1258,42,6,"And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1259,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them. Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1260,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1261,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1262,42,10,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1263,42,11,"We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1264,42,12,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1265,42,13,"And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1266,42,14,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1267,42,15,"hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1268,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1269,42,17,And he put them all together into ward three days.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1270,42,18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live: for I fear God:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1271,42,19,"if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1272,42,20,"and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1273,42,21,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1274,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1275,42,23,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1276,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1277,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done unto them.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1278,42,26,"And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1279,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1280,42,28,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1281,42,29,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1282,42,30,"The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1283,42,31,"And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1284,42,32,"we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1285,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take [grain for] the famine of your houses, and go your way;",ASV,Gen,Genesis

1287,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1288,42,36,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1289,42,37,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

1302,43,12,and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:,ASV,Gen,Genesis

1308,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1309,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1310,43,20,"and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1311,43,21,"and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1312,43,22,And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1313,43,23,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1314,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1315,43,25,And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1316,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1317,43,27,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1318,43,28,"And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1319,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1320,43,30,"And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1321,43,31,"And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1322,43,32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1323,43,33,"And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1324,43,34,"And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1325,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1326,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1327,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1328,44,4,"[And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1329,44,5,"Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1330,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1331,44,7,"And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1332,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1333,44,9,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

1335,44,11,"Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1336,44,12,"And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1337,44,13,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1338,44,14,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.,ASV,Gen,Genesis
1339,44,15,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1340,44,16,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1341,44,17,"And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1342,44,18,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1343,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?",ASV,Gen,Genesis

1345,44,21,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1346,44,22,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1347,44,23,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1348,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1349,44,25,"And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1350,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, expect our youngest brother be with us.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1351,44,27,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1352,44,28,"and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1353,44,29,"and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1354,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1355,44,31,"it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not [with us], that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1356,44,32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1357,44,33,"Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1358,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1359,45,1,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood before him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1360,45,2,"And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1361,45,3,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.",ASV,Gen,Genesis
1362,45,4,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

1364,45,6,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.",ASV,Gen,Genesis

4056,11,32,"And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4057,11,33,"While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.",ASV,Num,Numbers

4059,11,35,From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.,ASV,Num,Numbers
4060,12,1,And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.,ASV,Num,Numbers
4061,12,2,"And they said, Hath Jehovah indeed spoken only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it.",ASV,Num,Numbers

4063,12,4,"And Jehovah spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three came out.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4064,12,5,"And Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4065,12,6,"And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.",ASV,Num,Numbers

4091,13,16,These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.,ASV,Num,Numbers
4092,13,17,"And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:",ASV,Num,Numbers
4093,13,18,"and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;",ASV,Num,Numbers

4096,13,21,"So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4097,13,22,"And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)",ASV,Num,Numbers
4098,13,23,"And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4099,13,24,"That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4100,13,25,And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.,ASV,Num,Numbers
4101,13,26,"And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.",ASV,Num,Numbers

4106,13,31,"But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4107,13,32,"And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4108,13,33,"And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4109,14,1,"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.",ASV,Num,Numbers

4112,14,4,"And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4113,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.,ASV,Num,Numbers
4114,14,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:",ASV,Num,Numbers

4118,14,10,But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.,ASV,Num,Numbers
4119,14,11,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?",ASV,Num,Numbers
4120,14,12,"I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.",ASV,Num,Numbers
4121,14,13,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;",ASV,Num,Numbers

5947,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5948,5,14,"And he said, Nay; but [as] prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5949,5,15,"And the prince of Jehovah's host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.",ASV,Josh,Joshua

5954,6,5,"And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5955,6,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5956,6,7,"And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5957,6,8,"And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5958,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5959,6,10,"And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5960,6,11,"So he caused the ark of Jehovah to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5961,6,12,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5962,6,13,"And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Jehovah, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5963,6,14,"And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5964,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the city seven times.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5965,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Jehovah hath given you the city.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5966,6,17,"And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5967,6,18,"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5968,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5969,6,20,"So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5970,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5971,6,22,"And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5972,6,23,"And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5973,6,24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5974,6,25,"But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5975,6,26,"And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5976,6,27,So Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.,ASV,Josh,Joshua
5977,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5978,7,2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5979,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5980,7,4,So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.,ASV,Josh,Joshua
5981,7,5,"And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them [from] before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5982,7,6,"And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5983,7,7,"And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5984,7,8,"Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5985,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5986,7,10,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5987,7,11,"Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5988,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5989,7,13,"Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5990,7,14,"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5991,7,15,"And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5992,7,16,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5993,7,17,and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:,ASV,Josh,Joshua
5994,7,18,"and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5995,7,19,"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5996,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5997,7,21,"when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5998,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
5999,7,23,"And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before Jehovah.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6000,7,24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6001,7,25,"And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6002,7,26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6003,8,1,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6004,8,2,"And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6005,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6006,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6007,8,5,"and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6008,8,6,"and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6009,8,7,"and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6010,8,8,"And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6011,8,9,"And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6012,8,10,"And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6013,8,11,"And all the people, [even] the [men of] war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6014,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6015,8,13,"So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6016,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6017,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6018,8,16,"And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6019,8,17,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6020,8,18,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6021,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6022,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6023,8,21,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6024,8,22,"And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6025,8,23,"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6026,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6027,8,25,"And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6028,8,26,"For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6029,8,27,"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6030,8,28,"So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6031,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6032,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6033,8,31,"as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6034,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6035,8,33,"And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6036,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6037,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners that were among them.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6038,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6039,9,2,"that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6040,9,3,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6041,9,4,"they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6042,9,5,"and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6043,9,6,"And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6044,9,7,"And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6045,9,8,"And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6046,9,9,"And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,",ASV,Josh,Joshua

6048,9,11,"And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6049,9,12,"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6050,9,13,"and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6051,9,14,"And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6052,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6053,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6054,9,17,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6055,9,18,"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6056,9,19,"But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6057,9,20,"This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6058,9,21,"And the princes said unto them, Let them live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6059,9,22,"And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?",ASV,Josh,Joshua

6061,9,24,"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6062,9,25,"And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6063,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.",ASV,Josh,Joshua

6065,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6066,10,2,"that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6067,10,3,"Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,",ASV,Josh,Joshua

6069,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6070,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6071,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.",ASV,Josh,Joshua

6073,10,9,Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; [for] he went up from Gilgal all the night.,ASV,Josh,Joshua
6074,10,10,"And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6075,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6076,10,12,"Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6077,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.",ASV,Josh,Joshua

6084,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6085,10,21,that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.,ASV,Josh,Joshua

6092,10,28,"And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.",ASV,Josh,Joshua
6093,10,29,"And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:",ASV,Josh,Joshua

6586,3,18,"And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6587,3,19,"But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6588,3,20,"And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.",ASV,Judg,Judges

6614,4,15,"And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6615,4,16,"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6616,4,17,Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.,ASV,Judg,Judges
6617,4,18,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.",ASV,Judg,Judges

6620,4,21,"Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6621,4,22,"And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.",ASV,Judg,Judges

6988,17,8,"And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find [a place], and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6989,17,9,"And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place].",ASV,Judg,Judges
6990,17,10,"And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten [pieces] of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6991,17,11,And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.,ASV,Judg,Judges
6992,17,12,"And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6993,17,13,"Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6994,18,1,In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day [their] inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.,ASV,Judg,Judges
6995,18,2,"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6996,18,3,"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?",ASV,Judg,Judges
6997,18,4,"And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6998,18,5,"And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.",ASV,Judg,Judges
6999,18,6,"And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way wherein ye go.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7000,18,7,"Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put [them] to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7001,18,8,"And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What [say] ye?",ASV,Judg,Judges
7002,18,9,"And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7003,18,10,"When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large; for God hath given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7004,18,11,"And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7005,18,12,"And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, unto this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7006,18,13,"And they passed thence unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7007,18,14,"Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7008,18,15,"And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7009,18,16,"And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7010,18,17,"And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7011,18,18,"And when these went into Micah's house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye?",ASV,Judg,Judges
7012,18,19,"And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?",ASV,Judg,Judges
7013,18,20,"And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7014,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7015,18,22,"When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7016,18,23,"And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?",ASV,Judg,Judges
7017,18,24,"And he said, ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me, What aileth thee?",ASV,Judg,Judges
7018,18,25,"And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7019,18,26,"And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7020,18,27,"And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7021,18,28,"And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7022,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7023,18,30,"And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7024,18,31,"So they set them up Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7025,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7026,19,2,"And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7027,19,3,"And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7028,19,4,"And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7029,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7030,19,6,"So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsel's father said unto the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7031,19,7,"And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7032,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them.",ASV,Judg,Judges

7034,19,10,"But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7035,19,11,"When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7036,19,12,"And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7037,19,13,"And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7038,19,14,"So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7039,19,15,"And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7040,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7041,19,17,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?",ASV,Judg,Judges
7042,19,18,"And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am [now] going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that taketh me into his house.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7043,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants: there is no want of anything.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7044,19,20,"And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7045,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7046,19,22,"As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7047,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.",ASV,Judg,Judges

7053,19,29,"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7054,19,30,"And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.",ASV,Judg,Judges
7055,20,1,"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto Jehovah at Mizpah.",ASV,Judg,Judges

7267,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh's house?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7268,2,28,"and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7269,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7270,2,30,"Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7271,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7276,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7277,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7278,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7279,3,3,"and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down [to sleep], in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7280,3,4,"that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7281,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7282,3,6,"And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7283,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7284,3,8,"And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7285,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7286,3,10,"And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7287,3,11,"And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7288,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7290,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7291,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7292,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7293,3,17,"And he said, What is the thing that [Jehovah] hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7294,3,18,"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7295,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7296,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7297,3,21,And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7298,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7299,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7300,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7301,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth [above] the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7302,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7303,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7304,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7305,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7306,4,9,"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7307,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7308,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7309,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7310,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7311,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7312,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7313,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my son?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7314,4,17,"And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7315,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli] feel from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7316,4,19,"And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon her.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7317,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7318,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7319,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7320,5,1,"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7321,5,2,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7322,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7323,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay] cut off upon the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was left to him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7324,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7325,5,6,"But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7326,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7327,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel [thither].",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7328,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7329,5,10,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7330,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that is slay us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7331,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7332,6,1,And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7333,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? show us wherewith we shall sent it to its place.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7334,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7335,6,4,"Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7336,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7337,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7338,6,7,"Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7339,6,8,"and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7340,6,9,"And see; if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7341,6,10,"And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7342,6,11,"and they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7343,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7344,6,13,"And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7345,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7346,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto Jehovah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7347,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7348,6,17,"And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering unto Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7350,6,19,"And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah, he smote of the people seventy men, [and] fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7351,6,20,"And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7402,9,11,"As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7403,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before thee: make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7404,9,13,"as soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7405,9,14,"And they went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7406,9,15,"Now Jehovah had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7407,9,16,"To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7408,9,17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said unto him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7409,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7410,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7411,9,20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not they mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father's house?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7412,9,21,"And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7413,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7414,9,23,"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7416,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7417,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7418,9,27,"As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7419,10,1,"Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7420,10,2,"When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7421,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7423,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7424,10,6,"and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7427,10,9,"And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7428,10,10,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7429,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7430,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7431,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7432,10,14,"And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7433,10,15,"And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7434,10,16,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7435,10,17,And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah;,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7436,10,18,"and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7437,10,19,"but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, [Nay], but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7438,10,20,"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7439,10,21,"And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7440,10,22,"Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7441,10,23,"And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7442,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him along all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, [Long] live the king.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7443,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7444,10,26,"And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7445,10,27,"But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7446,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7447,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7448,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7449,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7450,11,5,"And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7451,11,6,"And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7452,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.

7453,11,8,"And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7454,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7455,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7456,11,11,"And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7457,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7464,12,4,"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7465,12,5,"And he said unto them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7466,12,6,"And Samuel said unto the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7467,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7468,12,8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7470,12,10,"And they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7471,12,11,"And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and ye dwelt in safety.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7472,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7473,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7474,12,14,"If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, [well]:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7481,12,21,"and turn ye not aside; for [then would ye go] after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7482,12,22,"For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7496,13,11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7497,13,12,"therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7498,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7499,13,14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7504,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7512,14,4,"And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7513,14,5,"The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7519,14,11,"And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7520,14,12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7521,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7522,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7523,14,15,"And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7524,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went [hither] and thither.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7535,14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7536,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day. And the people were faint.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7537,14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7538,14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now hath there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7539,14,31,And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint;,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7540,14,32,"and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7541,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, ye have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone unto me this day.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7542,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7543,14,35,And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah: the same was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7544,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7545,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7546,14,38,"And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7547,14,39,"For, as Jehovah liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7548,14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7549,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot]; but the people escaped.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7550,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7551,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7552,14,44,"And Saul said, God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7553,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7554,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7555,14,47,"Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he put [them] to the worse.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7556,14,48,"And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that despoiled them.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7557,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7558,14,50,"and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7559,14,51,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7560,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7561,15,1,"And Samuel said unto Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of Jehovah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7562,15,2,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7563,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7564,15,4,"And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7565,15,5,"And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7566,15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7567,15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7568,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7569,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7570,15,10,"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying,",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7571,15,11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7572,15,12,"And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7573,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7574,15,14,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7575,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7576,15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7577,15,17,"And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7578,15,18,"and Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7579,15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7580,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7581,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7582,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7583,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7584,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7585,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7586,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7587,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7588,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7589,15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7590,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7591,15,31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7592,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7593,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7594,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7595,15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7596,16,1,"And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7597,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7598,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7599,16,4,"And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7600,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto Jehovah: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7601,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7602,16,7,"But Jehovah said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for [Jehovah seeth] not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7603,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7604,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7605,16,10,"And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7606,16,11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7607,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7608,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7609,16,14,"Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7610,16,15,"And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7611,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7612,16,17,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7613,16,18,"Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7614,16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7615,16,20,"And Jesse took an ass [laden] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7616,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7617,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7618,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7619,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7620,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7621,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7622,17,4,"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7623,17,5,"And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7624,17,6,"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7625,17,7,And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7626,17,8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7627,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7628,17,10,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7629,17,11,"And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7630,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken [in years] among men.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7631,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7632,17,14,And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7633,17,15,Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7634,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7635,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry [them] quickly to the camp to thy brethren;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7636,17,18,"and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7637,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7638,17,20,"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7639,17,21,"And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7640,17,22,"And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7641,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7642,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7643,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7644,17,26,"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7645,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7646,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7647,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7648,17,30,"And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7649,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7650,17,32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7651,17,33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7652,17,34,"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father's sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7653,17,35,"I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7654,17,36,"Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7655,17,37,"And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7656,17,38,"And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7657,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7658,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7659,17,41,And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7660,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7661,17,43,"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7662,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7663,17,45,"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7664,17,46,"This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7665,17,47,"and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hand.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7666,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7667,17,49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7668,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7669,17,51,"Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7670,17,52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7671,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7672,17,54,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7673,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7674,17,56,"And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7675,17,57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7676,17,58,"And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7677,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7678,18,2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7679,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7680,18,4,"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7681,18,5,"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, [and] behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7682,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7683,18,7,"And the women sang one to another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7684,18,8,"And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7685,18,9,And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7686,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7687,18,11,"and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7688,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7689,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7690,18,14,And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7691,18,15,"And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7692,18,16,But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7693,18,17,"And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7694,18,18,"And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, [or] my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7695,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7696,18,20,"And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7697,18,21,"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7698,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants, [saying], Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7699,18,23,"And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7700,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7701,18,25,"And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7702,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. And the days were not expired;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7703,18,27,"and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7704,18,28,"And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7705,18,29,And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7706,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7707,19,1,"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7708,19,2,"And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7709,19,3,"and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7710,19,4,"And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7711,19,5,"for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7712,19,6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7713,19,7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7714,19,8,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7715,19,9,"And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7716,19,10,"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7717,19,11,"And Saul sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7718,19,12,"So Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7719,19,13,"And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' [hair] at the head thereof, and covered it with the clothes.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7720,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7721,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7722,19,16,"And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' [hair] at the head thereof.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7723,19,17,"And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, so that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7724,19,18,"Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7725,19,19,"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7726,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7727,19,21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7728,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7729,19,23,"And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7730,19,24,"And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7731,20,1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7732,20,2,"And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7733,20,3,"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7734,20,4,"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7735,20,5,"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7736,20,6,"If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7737,20,7,"If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7738,20,8,"Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee: but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7739,20,9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7740,20,10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7741,20,11,"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7742,20,12,"And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, [be witness]: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7743,20,13,"Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7744,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7745,20,15,"but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7746,20,16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying], And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David's enemies.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7747,20,17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7748,20,18,"Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7749,20,19,"And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7750,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7751,20,21,"And, behold, I will send the lad, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7752,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7753,20,23,"And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7754,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7755,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side: but David's place was empty.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7756,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7757,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, [which was] the second [day], that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7758,20,28,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7759,20,29,"and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me [to be there]: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king's table.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7760,20,30,"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother's nakedness?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7761,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7762,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7763,20,33,And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put David to death.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7764,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7765,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7766,20,36,"And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7767,20,37,"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7768,20,38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7769,20,39,But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7770,20,40,"And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7771,20,41,"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7772,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7773,21,1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7774,21,2,"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7775,21,3,"Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7776,21,4,"And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7777,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day shall their vessels be holy?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7778,21,6,"So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7779,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7780,21,8,"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7781,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7782,21,10,"And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7783,21,11,"And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7784,21,12,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7785,21,13,"And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7786,21,14,"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad; wherefore then have ye brought him to me?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7787,21,15,"Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7788,22,1,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7789,22,2,"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7790,22,3,"And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, [and be] with you, till I know what God will do for me.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7791,22,4,And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7792,22,5,"And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7793,22,6,"And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7794,22,7,"And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7795,22,8,"that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7796,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7797,22,10,"And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7798,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7799,22,12,"And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7800,22,13,"And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7801,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is taken into thy council, and is honorable in thy house?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7802,22,15,"Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute anything unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7803,22,16,"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7804,22,17,"And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of Jehovah; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7805,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7806,22,19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7807,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7864,25,3,"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7865,25,4,And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7866,25,5,"And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7868,25,7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7869,25,8,"Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7876,25,15,"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7877,25,16,"they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7886,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7887,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7888,25,27,"And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7895,25,34,"For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7896,25,35,"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7909,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7910,26,5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7911,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7945,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7946,28,4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7950,28,8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7951,28,9,"And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7952,28,10,"And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7953,28,11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7954,28,12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7955,28,13,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7956,28,14,"And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7957,28,15,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?

7958,28,16,"And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7962,28,20,"Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7963,28,21,"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7964,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7965,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7966,28,24,"And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7967,28,25,"and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7968,29,1,Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7969,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7970,29,3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do] these Hebrews [here]?

7971,29,4,"But he princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for wherewith should this [fellow] reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7972,29,5,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7973,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7974,29,7,"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7975,29,8,"And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7976,29,9,"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7977,29,10,"Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7978,29,11,"So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7979,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7980,30,2,"and had taken captive the women [and all] that were therein, both small and great: they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7981,30,3,"And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7982,30,4,"Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7983,30,5,"And David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7984,30,6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7985,30,7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7986,30,8,"And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake [them], and shalt without fail recover [all].",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7987,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

7989,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7990,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7991,30,13,"And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7992,30,14,"We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7993,30,15,"And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7994,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7995,30,17,"And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7996,30,18,And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.,ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7997,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7998,30,20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before those [other] cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
7999,30,21,"And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
8000,30,22,"Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
8001,30,23,"Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

8013,31,4,"Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
8014,31,5,"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
8015,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel
8016,31,7,"And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.",ASV,1Sam,1 Samuel

8078,2,29,"And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8079,2,30,"And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8080,2,31,"But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three hundred and threescore men died.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8081,2,32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8082,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8083,3,2,"And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8084,3,3,"and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8085,3,4,"and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8086,3,5,"and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8087,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8088,3,7,"Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8089,3,8,"Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8090,3,9,"God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8091,3,10,"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8092,3,11,"And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8093,3,12,"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying [also], Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8094,3,13,"And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8095,3,14,"And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8096,3,15,"And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8097,3,16,"And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8098,3,17,"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8099,3,18,"now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8100,3,19,"And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8101,3,20,"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8102,3,21,"And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8103,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8104,3,23,"When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8105,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8106,3,25,"Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8107,3,26,"And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8108,3,27,"And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8109,3,28,"And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8110,3,29,"let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8111,3,30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8112,3,31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8113,3,32,"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8114,3,33,"And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8115,3,34,"Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8116,3,35,"And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8117,3,36,"And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8118,3,37,So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8119,3,38,"And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8120,3,39,"And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8121,4,1,"And when [Ish-bosheth], Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8122,4,2,"And [Ish-bosheth], Saul's son, [had] two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8123,4,3,"and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8124,4,4,"Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8125,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8126,4,6,"And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8127,4,7,"Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8128,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8129,4,9,"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8130,4,10,"when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8131,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8132,4,12,"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8133,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8134,5,2,"In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8135,5,3,So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8136,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8137,5,5,In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8138,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David cannot come in hither.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8139,5,7,Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8140,5,8,"And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and [smite] the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8141,5,9,"And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8142,5,10,"And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8143,5,11,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8144,5,12,"And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8145,5,13,"And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8146,5,14,"And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8147,5,15,"and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8148,5,16,"and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8149,5,17,"And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8150,5,18,Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8151,5,19,"And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8152,5,20,"And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8153,5,21,And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8154,5,22,"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8155,5,23,"And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8156,5,24,"And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8157,5,25,"And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8158,6,1,"And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8159,6,2,"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth [above] the cherubim.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8160,6,3,"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8161,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8162,6,5,"And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of [instruments made of] fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8163,6,6,"And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8164,6,7,And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8165,6,8,"And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8166,6,9,"And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8167,6,10,So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8168,6,11,"And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8169,6,12,"And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8170,6,13,"And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8171,6,14,And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8172,6,15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8173,6,16,"And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8174,6,17,"And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8175,6,18,"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8176,6,19,"And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8177,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8178,6,21,"And David said unto Michal, [It was] before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8179,6,22,"And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8180,6,23,And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8181,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8182,7,2,"that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8183,7,3,"And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8184,7,4,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8185,7,5,"Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8186,7,6,"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8187,7,7,"In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8188,7,8,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8189,7,9,"and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8190,7,10,"And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8191,7,11,and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8192,7,12,"When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel

8195,7,15,"but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8196,7,16,And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8197,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel

8287,12,1,"And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8288,12,2,The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8289,12,3,"but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8290,12,4,"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel

8304,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8305,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel

8307,12,21,"Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8308,12,22,"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8309,12,23,"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel

8317,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.

8323,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let her sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8324,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8325,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8326,13,9,"And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8327,13,10,"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8328,13,11,"And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8329,13,12,"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8330,13,13,"And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8331,13,14,"Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8332,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel

8351,13,34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8352,13,35,"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8353,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8354,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8355,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8356,13,39,"And [the soul of] king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8357,14,1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8358,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8359,14,3,"and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8360,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8361,14,5,"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8362,14,6,"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8363,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8364,14,8,"And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8365,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8366,14,10,"And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8367,14,11,"Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8368,14,12,"Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8369,14,13,"And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8370,14,14,"For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8371,14,15,"Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8372,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8373,14,17,"Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8374,14,18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8375,14,19,"And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8376,14,20,"to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8377,14,21,"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8378,14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8379,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8380,14,24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8381,14,25,Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8382,14,26,"And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8383,14,27,"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8384,14,28,And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king's face.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8385,14,29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8386,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8387,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8388,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8389,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8390,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8391,15,2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8392,15,3,"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8393,15,4,"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8394,15,5,"And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8395,15,6,And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8396,15,7,"And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8397,15,8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8398,15,9,"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8399,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8400,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8401,15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8402,15,13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8403,15,14,"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8404,15,15,"And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8405,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8406,15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8407,15,18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8408,15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; [return] to thine own place.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8409,15,20,"Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8410,15,21,"And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8411,15,22,"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8412,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8413,15,24,"And, lo, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8414,15,25,"And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8415,15,26,"but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8416,15,27,"The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou [not] a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8417,15,28,"See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8418,15,29,Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8419,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of the [mount of] Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8420,15,31,"And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8421,15,32,"And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top [of the ascent], where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8422,15,33,"And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8423,15,34,"but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8424,15,35,"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8425,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8426,15,37,"So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8427,16,1,"And when David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8428,16,2,"And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8429,16,3,"And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8430,16,4,"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8431,16,5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8432,16,6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8433,16,7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8434,16,8,"Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art [taken] in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8435,16,9,"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8436,16,10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8437,16,11,"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8438,16,12,"It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8439,16,13,"So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8440,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8441,16,15,"And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8442,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8443,16,17,"And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8444,16,18,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8445,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8446,16,20,"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8447,16,21,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8448,16,22,So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8449,16,23,"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8450,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8451,17,2,"and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8452,17,3,and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: [so] all the people shall be in peace.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8453,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8454,17,5,"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8455,17,6,"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do [after] his saying? if not, speak thou.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8456,17,7,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8457,17,8,"Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8458,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8459,17,10,"And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8460,17,11,"But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8461,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8462,17,13,"Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8463,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8464,17,15,"Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8465,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8466,17,17,Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8467,17,18,"But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8468,17,19,"And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8469,17,20,"And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8470,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8471,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8472,17,23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8473,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8474,17,25,"And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8475,17,26,And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel

8477,17,28,"brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse],",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8478,17,29,"and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8479,18,1,"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8480,18,2,"And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8481,18,3,"But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8482,18,4,"And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8483,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8484,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8485,18,7,"And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8486,18,8,For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8487,18,9,"And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8488,18,10,"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8489,18,11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten [pieces of] silver, and a girdle.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8490,18,12,"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [pieces of] silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8491,18,13,"Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against [me].",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8492,18,14,"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8493,18,15,"And ten young men that bare Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8494,18,16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8495,18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8496,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, unto this day.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8497,18,19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that Jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8498,18,20,"And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8499,18,21,"Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8500,18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8501,18,23,"But come what may, [said he], I will run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8502,18,24,"Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8503,18,25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8504,18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold, [another] man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8505,18,27,"And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8506,18,28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8507,18,29,"And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8508,18,30,"And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8509,18,31,"And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king; for Jehovah hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8510,18,32,"And the king said unto the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8511,18,33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8512,19,1,"And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8513,19,2,"And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8514,19,3,"And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8515,19,4,"And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8516,19,5,"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8517,19,6,"in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8518,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8519,19,8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8520,19,9,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8521,19,10,"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8522,19,11,"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, [to bring him] to his house.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8523,19,12,"Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8524,19,13,"And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8525,19,14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of] one man; so that they sent unto the king, [saying], Return thou, and all thy servants.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8526,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8527,19,16,"And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8528,19,17,"And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8529,19,18,"And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8530,19,19,"And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8531,19,20,"For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8532,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah's anointed?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8533,19,22,"And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8534,19,23,"And the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8535,19,24,"And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8536,19,25,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8537,19,26,"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8538,19,27,And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8539,19,28,For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king?,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8540,19,29,"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8541,19,30,"And Mephibosheth said unto the king, yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8542,19,31,"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8543,19,32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8544,19,33,"And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8545,19,34,"And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8546,19,35,I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8547,19,36,Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8548,19,37,"Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8549,19,38,"And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8550,19,39,"And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8551,19,40,"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8552,19,41,"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8553,19,42,"And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8554,19,43,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right] in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8555,20,1,"And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8556,20,2,"So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8557,20,3,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8558,20,4,"Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8559,20,5,So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8560,20,6,"And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8561,20,7,"And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8562,20,8,"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8563,20,9,"And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8564,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8565,20,11,"And there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8566,20,12,"And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8567,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8568,20,14,"And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8569,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8570,20,16,"Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8571,20,17,"And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8572,20,18,"Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel: and so they ended [the matter].",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8573,20,19,I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?,ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8574,20,20,"And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8575,20,21,"The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel
8576,20,22,"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.",ASV,2Sam,2 Samuel

8899,6,3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; [and] ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8900,6,4,And for the house he made windows of fixed lattice-work.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8901,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8902,6,6,"The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house round about, that [the beams] should not have hold in the walls of the house.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8903,6,7,"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8904,6,8,"The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle [story], and out of the middle into the third.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8905,6,9,"So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8906,6,10,"And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8907,6,11,"And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8908,6,12,"Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8909,6,13,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8910,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8911,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8912,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls [of the ceiling]: he built [them] for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8913,6,17,"And the house, that is, the temple before [the oracle], was forty cubits [long].",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8914,6,18,"And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8915,6,19,"And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8916,6,20,"And within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8917,6,21,So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8918,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8919,6,23,"And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8920,6,24,"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8921,6,25,And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8922,6,26,"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8923,6,27,"And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8924,6,28,And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8925,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8926,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8927,6,31,And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel [and] door-posts were a fifth part [of the wall].,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8928,6,32,"So [he made] two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8929,6,33,"So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part [of the wall];",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8930,6,34,"and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8931,6,35,And he carved [thereon] cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8932,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8933,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8934,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8935,7,1,"And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8936,7,2,"For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8937,7,3,"And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8938,7,4,"And there were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8939,7,5,And all the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8940,7,6,"And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8941,7,7,"And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8942,7,8,"And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like unto this porch.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8943,7,9,"All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8944,7,10,"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8945,7,11,"And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8946,7,12,"And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8947,7,13,And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8948,7,14,"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8949,7,15,"For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8950,7,16,"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8951,7,17,"There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8952,7,18,"So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8953,7,19,"And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8954,7,20,"And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8955,7,21,"And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8956,7,22,And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8957,7,23,"And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8958,7,24,"And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8959,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8960,7,26,"And it was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8961,7,27,"And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8962,7,28,And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8963,7,29,"and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8964,7,30,"And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8965,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8966,7,32,And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8967,7,33,"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8968,7,34,And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8969,7,35,And in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8970,7,36,"And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the panels thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8971,7,37,"After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8972,7,38,And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon very one of the ten bases one laver.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8973,7,39,"And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8974,7,40,"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8975,7,41,"the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8976,7,42,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8977,7,43,"and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8978,7,44,"and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8979,7,45,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Jehovah, were of burnished brass.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8980,7,46,"In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8981,7,47,"And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8982,7,48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8983,7,49,"and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8984,7,50,"and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8985,7,51,"Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8986,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8987,8,2,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8988,8,3,"And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8989,8,4,"And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8990,8,5,"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8991,8,6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8992,8,7,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8993,8,8,And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8994,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8995,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8996,8,11,so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8997,8,12,"Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8998,8,13,"I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
8999,8,14,"And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9000,8,15,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David thy father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9001,8,16,"Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9002,8,17,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9003,8,18,"But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9004,8,19,"nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9005,8,20,"And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings

9007,8,22,"And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9008,8,23,"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9009,8,24,"who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9010,8,25,"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9011,8,26,"Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings

9039,8,54,"And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9040,8,55,"And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9041,8,56,"Blessed be Jehovah, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9042,8,57,"Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings

9044,8,59,"And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh unto Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9045,8,60,"that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9046,8,61,"Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9047,8,62,"And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9048,8,63,"And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9049,8,64,"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9050,8,65,"So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9051,8,66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David his servant, and to Israel his people.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9052,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9053,9,2,"that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9054,9,3,"And Jehovah said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9055,9,4,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9056,9,5,"then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9057,9,6,"But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9058,9,7,"then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9059,9,8,"And though this house is so high, yet shall every one that passeth by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9060,9,9,"and they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath Jehovah brought all this evil upon them.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9061,9,10,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king's house",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9062,9,11,"(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9063,9,12,And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9064,9,13,"And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9065,9,14,And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9066,9,15,"And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9067,9,16,"Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9068,9,17,"And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9069,9,18,"and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9070,9,19,"and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9071,9,20,"As for all the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9072,9,21,"their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9073,9,22,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9074,9,23,"These were the chief officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9075,9,24,But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which [Solomon] had built for her: then did he build Millo.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9076,9,25,"And three times a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto Jehovah, burning incense therewith, [upon the altar] that was before Jehovah. So he finished the house.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9077,9,26,"And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9078,9,27,"And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9079,9,28,"And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9080,10,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9081,10,2,"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9082,10,3,And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9083,10,4,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9084,10,5,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9085,10,6,"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9086,10,7,"Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9087,10,8,"Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, [and] that hear thy wisdom.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9088,10,9,"Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9089,10,10,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9090,10,11,"And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9091,10,12,"And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9092,10,13,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9093,10,14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9094,10,15,"besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9095,10,16,And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9096,10,17,And [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9097,10,18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9098,10,19,"There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9099,10,20,And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9100,10,21,"And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9101,10,22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9102,10,23,So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.,ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9103,10,24,"And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9104,10,25,"And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9105,10,26,"And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9106,10,27,"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9107,10,28,"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9108,10,29,"And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9109,11,1,"Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9110,11,2,"of the nations concerning which Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9111,11,3,"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9112,11,4,"For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of David his father.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9113,11,5,"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9114,11,6,"And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9115,11,7,"Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9116,11,8,"And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9117,11,9,"And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9118,11,10,"and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9119,11,11,"Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9120,11,12,"Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9121,11,13,"Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9122,11,14,"And Jehovah raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9123,11,15,"For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9124,11,16,"(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9125,11,17,"that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9126,11,18,"And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9127,11,19,"And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9128,11,20,"And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9129,11,21,"And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9130,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit only let me depart.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9131,11,23,"And God raised up [another] adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9132,11,24,"And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9133,11,25,"And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9134,11,26,"And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9135,11,27,"And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9136,11,28,"And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9137,11,29,"And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9138,11,30,"And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9139,11,31,"And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings

9141,11,33,"because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and mine ordinances, as did David his father.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9142,11,34,"Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings

9159,12,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9160,12,9,"And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9161,12,10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9162,12,11,"And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings

9166,12,15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings
9167,12,16,"And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David.

9168,12,17,"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.",ASV,1Kgs,1 Kings

9566,2,15,"And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9567,2,16,"And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9568,2,17,"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9569,2,18,"And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9570,2,19,"And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9571,2,20,"And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9572,2,21,"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9573,2,22,"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9574,2,23,"And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9575,2,24,"And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9576,2,25,"And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9577,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9578,3,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9579,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9580,3,4,"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9581,3,5,"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9582,3,6,"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9583,3,7,"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9584,3,8,"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9585,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9586,3,10,"And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9587,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9588,3,12,"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9589,3,13,"And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9590,3,14,"And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9591,3,15,"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9592,3,16,"And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9593,3,17,"For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9594,3,18,And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.,ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9595,3,19,"And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9596,3,20,"And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9597,3,21,"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9598,3,22,"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9599,3,23,"and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9600,3,24,"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9601,3,25,"And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth [only] they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9602,3,26,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9603,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9604,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9605,4,2,"And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9606,4,3,"Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9607,4,4,"And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9608,4,5,"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9609,4,6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9610,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9611,4,8,"And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9612,4,9,"And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9613,4,10,"Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9614,4,11,"And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9615,4,12,"And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9616,4,13,"And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9617,4,14,"And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9618,4,15,"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9619,4,16,"And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9620,4,17,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9621,4,18,"And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9622,4,19,"And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9623,4,20,"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9624,4,21,"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] upon him, and went out.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9625,4,22,"And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9626,4,23,"And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9627,4,24,"Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9628,4,25,"So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9629,4,26,"run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9630,4,27,"And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9631,4,28,"Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9632,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9633,4,30,"And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9634,4,31,"And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9635,4,32,"And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9636,4,33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9637,4,34,"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9638,4,35,"Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9639,4,36,"And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9640,4,37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9641,4,38,"And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9642,4,39,"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9643,4,40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9644,4,41,"But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9645,4,42,"And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9646,4,43,"And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9647,4,44,"So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Jehovah.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9648,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory unto Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, [but he was] a leper.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9649,5,2,"And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman's wife.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9650,5,3,"And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9651,5,4,"And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden that is of the land of Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9652,5,5,"And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9653,5,6,"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9654,5,7,"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9655,5,8,"And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9656,5,9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9657,5,10,"And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9658,5,11,"But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9659,5,12,"Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9660,5,13,"And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9661,5,14,"Then went he down, and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9662,5,15,"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9663,5,16,"But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9664,5,17,"And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto Jehovah.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9665,5,18,"In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9666,5,19,"And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9667,5,20,"But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9668,5,21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9669,5,22,"And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9670,5,23,"And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9671,5,24,"And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9672,5,25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9673,5,26,"And he said unto him, Went not my heart [with thee], when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9674,5,27,"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9675,6,1,"And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9676,6,2,"Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9677,6,3,"And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9678,6,4,"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9679,6,5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9680,6,6,"And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9681,6,7,"And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9682,6,8,"Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9683,6,9,"And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are coming down.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9684,6,10,"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9685,6,11,"And the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9686,6,12,"And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9687,6,13,"And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9688,6,14,"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings

9691,6,17,"And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9692,6,18,"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9693,6,19,"And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9694,6,20,"And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings

9700,6,26,"And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9701,6,27,"And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings

9706,6,32,"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9707,6,33,"And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings

9714,7,7,"Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9715,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9716,7,9,"Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings
9717,7,10,"So they came and called unto the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings

9740,8,13,"And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.",ASV,1Kgs,2 Kings

12361,4,2,"And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12362,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah

12365,4,6,So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half [the height] thereof: for the people had a mind to work.,ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12366,4,7,"But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12367,4,8,"and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12368,4,9,"But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah

12372,4,13,"Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12373,4,14,"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12374,4,15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12375,4,16,"And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12376,4,17,"They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12377,4,18,"and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12378,4,19,"And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12379,4,20,"in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12380,4,21,So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.,ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12381,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12382,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one [went with] his weapon [to] the water.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12383,5,1,Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.,ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12384,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12385,5,3,"Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12386,5,4,"There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute [upon] our fields and our vineyards.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12387,5,5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12388,5,6,And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.,ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12389,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12390,5,8,"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12391,5,9,"Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12392,5,10,"And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12393,5,11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12394,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12395,5,13,"Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12396,5,14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12397,5,15,"But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12398,5,16,"Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12399,5,17,"Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12400,5,18,"Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12401,5,19,"Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12402,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12403,6,2,"that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12404,6,3,"And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12405,6,4,And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.,ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12406,6,5,"Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12407,6,6,"wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12408,6,7,"And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12409,6,8,"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12410,6,9,"For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, [O God], strengthen thou my hands.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12411,6,10,"And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12412,6,11,"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12413,6,12,"And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12414,6,13,"For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12415,6,14,"Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12416,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12417,6,16,"And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard [thereof], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12418,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12419,6,18,"For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12420,6,19,"Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12421,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12422,7,2,"that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12423,7,3,"And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand [on guard], let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] over against his house.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12424,7,4,"Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12425,7,5,"And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah

12682,13,11,"Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12683,13,12,Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.,ASV,Neh,Nehemiah

12687,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12688,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12689,13,18,"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12690,13,19,"And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12691,13,20,So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.,ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12692,13,21,"Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12693,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah

12696,13,25,"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah
12697,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.",ASV,Neh,Nehemiah

12707,1,5,"And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12708,1,6,"[There were hangings of] white [cloth], [of] green, and [of] blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12709,1,7,"And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12710,1,8,"And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12711,1,9,Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12712,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,",ASV,Esth,Esther
12713,1,11,"to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12714,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12715,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment;",ASV,Esth,Esther
12716,1,14,"and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),",ASV,Esth,Esther
12717,1,15,"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?",ASV,Esth,Esther

12719,1,17,"For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12720,1,18,And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say [the like] unto all the king's princes. So [will there arise] much contempt and wrath.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12721,1,19,"If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12722,1,20,"And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12723,1,21,And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:,ASV,Esth,Esther
12724,1,22,"for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12725,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.",ASV,Esth,Esther

12728,2,4,and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12729,2,5,"There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,",ASV,Esth,Esther
12730,2,6,"who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12731,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12732,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12733,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king's house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12734,2,10,Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12735,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12736,2,12,"Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),",ASV,Esth,Esther
12737,2,13,then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12738,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12739,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12740,2,16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12741,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12742,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12743,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12744,2,20,"Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12745,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12746,2,22,"And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king [thereof] in Mordecai's name.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12747,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12748,3,1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12749,3,2,"And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12750,3,3,"Then the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?",ASV,Esth,Esther
12751,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12752,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12753,3,6,"But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12754,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], which is the month Adar.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12755,3,8,"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12756,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the [king's] business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12757,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12758,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12759,3,12,"Then were the king's scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king's satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king's ring.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12760,3,13,"And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12761,3,14,"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12762,3,15,"The posts went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12763,4,1,"Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;",ASV,Esth,Esther
12764,4,2,and he came even before the king's gate: for none might enter within the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12765,4,3,"And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12766,4,4,"And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12767,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12768,4,6,"So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12769,4,7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12770,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12771,4,9,And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12772,4,10,"Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai [saying]:",ASV,Esth,Esther
12773,4,11,"All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12774,4,12,And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12775,4,13,"Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12776,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?",ASV,Esth,Esther
12777,4,15,"Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,",ASV,Esth,Esther
12778,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12779,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12780,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12781,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12782,5,3,"Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12783,5,4,"And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12784,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12785,5,6,"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12786,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:",ASV,Esth,Esther
12787,5,8,"if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12788,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12789,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12790,5,11,"And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12791,5,12,"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12792,5,13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12793,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12794,6,1,"On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12795,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12796,6,3,"And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12797,6,4,"And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12798,6,5,"And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12799,6,6,"So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?",ASV,Esth,Esther
12800,6,7,"And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,",ASV,Esth,Esther
12801,6,8,"let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:",ASV,Esth,Esther
12802,6,9,"and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12803,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12804,6,11,"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12805,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12806,6,13,"And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12807,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12808,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12809,7,2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12810,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:",ASV,Esth,Esther
12811,7,4,"for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's damage.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12812,7,5,"Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?",ASV,Esth,Esther
12813,7,6,"And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12814,7,7,And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine [and went] into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12815,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12816,7,9,"Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12817,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12818,8,1,On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.,ASV,Esth,Esther
12819,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12820,8,3,"And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12821,8,4,"Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12822,8,5,"And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king's provinces:",ASV,Esth,Esther
12823,8,6,for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?,ASV,Esth,Esther
12824,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12825,8,8,"Write ye also to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12826,8,9,"Then were the king's scribes called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the three and twentieth [day] thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12827,8,10,"And he wrote the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by post on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king's service, bred of the stud:",ASV,Esth,Esther
12828,8,11,"wherein the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, [their] little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,",ASV,Esth,Esther

12830,8,13,"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12831,8,14,"So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king's service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12832,8,15,"And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.",ASV,Esth,Esther

12836,9,2,"the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12837,9,3,"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king's business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12838,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.",ASV,Esth,Esther
12839,9,5,"And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them.",ASV,Esth,Esther

12859,9,25,"but when [the matter] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.",ASV,Esth,Esther

19913,38,18,"But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19914,38,19,"And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19915,38,20,"But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19916,38,21,"But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me:",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19917,38,22,"behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: [now that] thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19918,38,23,"And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19919,38,24,"Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19920,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19921,38,26,"then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19922,38,27,"Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19923,38,28,So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.,ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19924,39,1,"And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19925,39,2,"in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city,)",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19926,39,3,"that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, [to wit], Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19927,39,4,"And it came to pass that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, through the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19928,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19929,39,6,Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.,ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19930,39,7,"Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19931,39,8,"And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19932,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19933,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19934,39,11,"Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19935,39,12,"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19936,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19937,39,14,"they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19938,39,15,"Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19939,39,16,"Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah

19941,39,18,"For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19942,40,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19943,40,2,"And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place;",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19944,40,3,"and Jehovah hath brought it, and done according as he spake: because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19945,40,4,"And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, thither go.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19946,40,5,"Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, [said he], to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present, and let him go.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19947,40,6,"Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19948,40,7,"Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19949,40,8,"then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, [to wit], Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19950,40,9,"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah

19952,40,11,"Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19953,40,12,"then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19954,40,13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah

19956,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19957,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19958,41,1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and [one of] the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19959,41,2,"Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19960,41,3,"Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, [to wit], with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19961,41,4,"And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19962,41,5,"that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19963,41,6,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19964,41,7,"And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19965,41,8,"But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19966,41,9,"Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel,) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19967,41,10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah
19968,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah

19974,41,17,"and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah

19976,42,1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,",ASV,Jer,Jeremiah

20482,1,18,"As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20483,1,19,"And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20484,1,20,"Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20485,1,21,"When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20486,1,22,"And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20487,1,23,"And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20488,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20489,1,25,"And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20490,1,26,"And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20491,1,27,"And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20492,1,28,"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20493,2,1,"And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20494,2,2,"And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20495,2,3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20496,2,4,"And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do sent thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20497,2,5,"And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20498,2,6,"And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20499,2,7,"And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20500,2,8,"But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20501,2,9,"And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20502,2,10,"And he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20503,3,1,"And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20504,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20505,3,3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20506,3,4,"And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20507,3,5,"For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20508,3,6,"not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20509,3,7,But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20510,3,8,"Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20511,3,9,"As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20512,3,10,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20513,3,11,"And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20514,3,12,"Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20515,3,13,"And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20516,3,14,"So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20517,3,15,"Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20518,3,16,"And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20519,3,17,"Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20520,3,18,"When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20521,3,19,"Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20522,3,20,"Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20523,3,21,"Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20524,3,22,"And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20525,3,23,"Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20526,3,24,"Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20527,3,25,"But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20528,3,26,"and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20529,3,27,"But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20530,4,1,"Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20531,4,2,"and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20532,4,3,"And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20533,4,4,"Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; [according to] the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20534,4,5,"For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20535,4,6,"And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20536,4,7,"And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20537,4,8,"And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20538,4,9,"Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; [according to] the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20539,4,10,"And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20540,4,11,"And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20541,4,12,"And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20542,4,13,"And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20543,4,14,"Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20544,4,15,"Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20545,4,16,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20546,4,17,"that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20547,5,1,"And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword; [as] a barber's razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20548,5,2,"A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20549,5,3,"And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20550,5,4,"And of these again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

20620,8,16,"And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah's house; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20621,8,17,"Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen [this], O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20622,8,18,"Therefore will I also deal in wrath; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20623,9,1,"Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20624,9,2,"And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20625,9,3,"And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn by his side.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20626,9,4,"And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20627,9,5,"And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20628,9,6,"slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20629,9,7,"And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20630,9,8,"And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20631,9,9,"Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wrestling [of judgment]: for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20632,9,10,"And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20633,9,11,"And behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20634,10,1,"Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20635,10,2,"And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20636,10,3,"Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20637,10,4,"And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20638,10,5,"And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20639,10,6,"And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20640,10,7,"And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took [thereof], and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20641,10,8,And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20642,10,9,"And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20643,10,10,"And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel have been within a wheel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20644,10,11,"When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20645,10,12,"And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that they four had.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20646,10,13,"As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling [wheels].",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20647,10,14,"And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20648,10,15,And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20649,10,16,"And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20650,10,17,"When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20651,10,18,"And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20652,10,19,"And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20653,10,20,This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20654,10,21,"Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20655,10,22,"And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20656,11,1,"Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah's house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20657,11,2,"And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20658,11,3,"that say, [The time] is not near to build houses: this [city] is the caldron, and we are the flesh.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20659,11,4,"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20660,11,5,"And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20661,11,6,"Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20662,11,7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this [city] is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20663,11,8,"Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20664,11,9,"And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20665,11,10,Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20666,11,11,"This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20667,11,12,"and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20668,11,13,"And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20669,11,14,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20670,11,15,"Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, [are they] unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20671,11,16,"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20672,11,17,"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20673,11,18,"And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20674,11,19,"And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20675,11,20,"that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20676,11,21,"But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20677,11,22,"Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20678,11,23,"And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20679,11,24,"And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20680,11,25,Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had showed me.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20681,12,1,"The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20682,12,2,"Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20683,12,3,"Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20684,12,4,"And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20685,12,5,"Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20686,12,6,"In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20687,12,7,"And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20688,12,8,"And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20689,12,9,"Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20690,12,10,"Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden [concerneth] the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20691,12,11,"Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20692,12,12,"And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20693,12,13,"My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20694,12,14,"And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20695,12,15,"And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20696,12,16,"But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20697,12,17,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20698,12,18,"Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20699,12,19,"and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, [and despoiled] of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20700,12,20,"And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20701,12,21,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20702,12,22,"Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20703,12,23,"Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20704,12,24,For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20705,12,25,"For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20706,12,26,"Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20707,12,27,"Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many day to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20708,12,28,"Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20709,13,1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20710,13,2,"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah:",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20711,13,3,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20712,13,4,"O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20713,13,5,"Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20714,13,6,"They have seen falsehood and lying divination, that say, Jehovah saith; but Jehovah hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20715,13,7,"Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah saith; albeit I have not spoken?",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20716,13,8,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20717,13,9,"And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20718,13,10,"Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered [mortar]:",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20719,13,11,"say unto them that daub it with untempered [mortar], that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20720,13,12,"Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20721,13,13,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20722,13,14,"So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20723,13,15,"Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered [mortar]; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20724,13,16,"[to wit], the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20725,13,17,"And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20726,13,18,"and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of [persons of] every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20727,13,19,"And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20728,13,20,"Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make [them] fly.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20729,13,21,"Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20730,13,22,"Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20731,13,23,"Therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20732,14,1,"Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

20739,14,8,"and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

20901,20,6,"in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
20902,20,7,"And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

21458,39,10,"so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21459,39,11,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21460,39,12,"And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

21478,40,1,"In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21479,40,2,"In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

21481,40,4,"And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21482,40,5,"And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21483,40,6,"Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21484,40,7,"And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

21515,40,38,And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21516,40,39,"And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21517,40,40,"And on the [one] side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21518,40,41,"Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew [the sacrifices].",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21519,40,42,"And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21520,40,43,"And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21521,40,44,"And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21522,40,45,"And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21523,40,46,"and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21524,40,47,"And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21525,40,48,"Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21526,40,49,"The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21527,41,1,"And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21528,41,2,"And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

21530,41,4,"And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21531,41,5,"Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21532,41,6,"And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold [therein], and not have hold in the wall of the house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21533,41,7,And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed [the house] higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house [continued] upward; and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the middle [chamber].,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21534,41,8,I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21535,41,9,"The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21536,41,10,And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21537,41,11,"And the doors of the side-chambers were toward [the place] that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21538,41,12,"And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21539,41,13,"So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21540,41,14,"also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21541,41,15,"And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21542,41,16,"the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and [from] the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21543,41,17,"to [the space] above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21544,41,18,"And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21545,41,19,"so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. [thus was it] made through all the house round about:",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21546,41,20,from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21547,41,21,"As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance [thereof] was as the appearance [of the temple].",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21548,41,22,"The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21549,41,23,And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21550,41,24,"And the doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves: two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21551,41,25,"And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21552,41,26,"And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21553,42,1,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21554,42,2,"Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21555,42,3,"Over against the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21556,42,4,"And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21557,42,5,"Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21558,42,6,"For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the uppermost] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21559,42,7,"And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21560,42,8,"For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21561,42,9,"And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21562,42,10,"In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21563,42,11,"And the way before them was like the appearance of [the way of] the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21564,42,12,"And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21565,42,13,"Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21566,42,14,"When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21567,42,15,"Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21568,42,16,"He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21569,42,17,He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21570,42,18,He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21571,42,19,"He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21572,42,20,"He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21573,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21574,43,2,"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21575,43,3,"And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21576,43,4,And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21577,43,5,"And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21578,43,6,And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me.,ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel
21579,43,7,"And he said unto me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever.

21580,43,8,"in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was [but] the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.",ASV,Ezek,Ezekiel

21765,2,7,"They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21766,2,8,"The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21767,2,9,"But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21768,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21769,2,11,"And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21770,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21771,2,13,"So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21772,2,14,"Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21773,2,15,"he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21774,2,16,"And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21775,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21776,2,18,that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should nor perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21777,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21778,2,20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21779,2,21,"And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21780,2,22,"he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21781,2,23,"I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21782,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21783,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21784,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21785,2,27,"Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21786,2,28,"but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21787,2,29,"as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21788,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21789,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21790,2,32,"As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21791,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21792,2,34,"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21793,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21794,2,36,This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21795,2,37,"Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21796,2,38,"and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21797,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21798,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21799,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21800,2,42,"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21801,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21802,2,44,"And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21803,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21804,2,46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21805,2,47,"The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21806,2,48,"Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21807,2,49,"And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21808,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21809,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21810,3,3,"Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21811,3,4,"Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21812,3,5,"that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21813,3,6,and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21814,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21815,3,8,"Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21816,3,9,"They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21817,3,10,"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21818,3,11,"and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21819,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21820,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21821,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21822,3,15,"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21823,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21824,3,17,"If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21825,3,18,"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21826,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: [therefore] he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21827,3,20,"And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21828,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21829,3,22,"Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21830,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21831,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21832,3,25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21833,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21834,3,27,"And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21835,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21836,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.",ASV,Dan,Daniel

21841,4,4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21842,4,5,I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21843,4,6,"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21844,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21845,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, [saying],",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21846,4,9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21847,4,10,"Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21848,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21849,4,12,"The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21850,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21851,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21852,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21853,4,16,"let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21854,4,17,"The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21855,4,18,"This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21856,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21857,4,20,"The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21858,4,21,"whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation:",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21859,4,22,"it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21860,4,23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21861,4,24,"this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21862,4,25,"that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21863,4,26,"And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21864,4,27,"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21865,4,28,All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21866,4,29,At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21867,4,30,"The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21868,4,31,"While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee:",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21869,4,32,"and thou shalt be driven from men; and they dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21870,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21871,4,34,"And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21872,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21873,4,36,"At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21874,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21875,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21876,5,2,"Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink therefrom.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21877,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21878,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21879,5,5,"In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21880,5,6,"Then the king's countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21881,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21882,5,8,"Then came in all the king's wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21883,5,9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21884,5,10,"[Now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live forever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21885,5,11,"There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, [I say], thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21886,5,12,"forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21887,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21888,5,14,"I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21889,5,15,"And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21890,5,16,"But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21891,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21892,5,18,"O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21893,5,19,"and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21894,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21895,5,21,"and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts', and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21896,5,22,"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this,",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21897,5,23,"but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21898,5,24,"Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21899,5,25,"And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21900,5,26,"This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21901,5,27,"TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21902,5,28,"PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21903,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21904,5,30,In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21905,5,31,"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21906,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21907,6,2,"and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21908,6,3,"Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21909,6,4,"Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21910,6,5,"Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21911,6,6,"Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21912,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21913,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21914,6,9,Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21915,6,10,"And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21916,6,11,"Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21917,6,12,"Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21918,6,13,"Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21919,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21920,6,15,"Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21921,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. [Now] the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21922,6,17,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21923,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21924,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21925,6,20,"And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21926,6,21,"Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21927,6,22,"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21928,6,23,"Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21929,6,24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21930,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21931,6,26,"I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21932,6,27,"He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21933,6,28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21934,7,1,In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.,ASV,Dan,Daniel
21935,7,2,"Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21936,7,3,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21937,7,4,"The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21938,7,5,"And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21939,7,6,"After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21940,7,7,"After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21941,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21942,7,9,"I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] the wheels thereof burning fire.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21943,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21944,7,11,"I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21945,7,12,"And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21946,7,13,"I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21947,7,14,"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21948,7,15,"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21949,7,16,"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21950,7,17,"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21951,7,18,"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21952,7,19,"Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21953,7,20,"and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21954,7,21,"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21955,7,22,"until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21956,7,23,"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21957,7,24,"And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21958,7,25,"And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21959,7,26,"But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21960,7,27,"And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21961,7,28,"Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21962,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21963,8,2,"And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21964,8,3,"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21965,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21966,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21967,8,6,"And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21968,8,7,"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21969,8,8,"And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21970,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21971,8,10,"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21972,8,11,"Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt-offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21973,8,12,"And the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt-offering] through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21974,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?",ASV,Dan,Daniel
21975,8,14,"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.",ASV,Dan,Daniel
