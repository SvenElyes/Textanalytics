		<Chapter id='1'>
			<Verse id='1'>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And the evening and the morning were the third day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And the evening and the morning were the fourth day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And the evening and the morning were the fifth day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creeps upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creeps upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='2'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an associated helper for him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an associated helper for him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='3'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, has God said, All of you shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, All of you shall not eat of it, neither shall all of you touch it, lest all of you die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And the serpent said unto the woman, All of you shall not surely die:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"For God does know that in the day all of you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and all of you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where are you?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you that you should not eat?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent misled me, and I did eat."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And unto Adam he said, Because you have hearkened unto the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return unto the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and unto dust shall you return."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='4'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And Adam had sexual contact with Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have got a man from the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And the LORD said unto Cain, Why are you angry? and why is your countenance fallen?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"If you do well, shall you not be accepted? and if you do not well, sin lies at the door. And unto you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries unto me from the ground."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And now are you cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"When you till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto you her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shall you be in the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad brings forth Mehujael: and Mehujael brings forth Methusael: and Methusael brings forth Lamech."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; all of you wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And Adam had sexual contact with his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD."</Verse>

			<Verse id='16'>"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, and every man:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='8'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were decreased."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth back and forth, until the waters were dried up from off the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were decreased from off the face of the ground;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were decreased from off the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"And, behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and thin; and stood by the other cattle upon the brink of the river."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And the ill favoured and thin cattle did eat up the seven well favoured and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke."</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."</Verse>

			<Verse id='19'>"And, behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And the lean and the ill favoured cattle did eat up the first seven fat cattle:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And the seven thin and ill favoured cattle that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he shows unto Pharaoh."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='31'>"And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven abundant years."</Verse>

			<Verse id='41'>"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest possibly mischief befall him."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, All of you take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift all of you up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even tomorrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near unto him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD does choose, he shall be holy: all of you take too much upon you, all of you sons of Levi."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, all of you sons of Levi:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Seems it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And he has brought you near to him, and all your brethren the sons of Levi with you: and seek all of you the priesthood also?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"For which cause both you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that all of you murmur against him?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except you make yourself altogether a prince over us?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Moreover you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And Moses was very angry, and said unto the LORD, Respect not you their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And Moses said unto Korah, Be you and all your company before the LORD, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring all of you before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each of you his censer."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest all of you be consumed in all their sins."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"And Moses said, Hereby all of you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD has not sent me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then all of you shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder; for they are hallowed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='39'>"And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='40'>"To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses."</Verse>
			<Verse id='41'>"But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, All of you have killed the people of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared."</Verse>
			<Verse id='43'>"And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation."</Verse>
			<Verse id='44'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='45'>"Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces."</Verse>
			<Verse id='46'>"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun."</Verse>
			<Verse id='47'>"And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='48'>"And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='49'>"Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='50'>"And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='17'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write you every man's name upon his rod."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And you shall write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And you shall lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And it came to pass, that on the next day Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Whosoever comes any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?"</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='18'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And the LORD said unto Aaron, You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And your brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring you with you, that they may be joined unto you, and minister unto you: but you and your sons with you shall minister before the tabernacle of witness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And they shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor all of you also, die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And they shall be joined unto you, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And all of you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and all of you shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes nigh shall be put to death."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And the LORD spoke unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given you the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance for ever."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every food offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"In the most holy place shall you eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be yours; every one that is clean in yours house shall eat of it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Every thing devoted in Israel shall be yours."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Every thing that opens the womb in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the first born of unclean beasts shall you redeem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to yours estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"But the first born of a cow, or the first born of a sheep, or the first born of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And the flesh of them shall be yours, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto you and to your seed with you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And the LORD spoke unto Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am your part and yours inheritance among the children of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When all of you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then all of you shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the winepress."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"Thus all of you also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which all of you receive of the children of Israel; and all of you shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"Out of all your gifts all of you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"Therefore you shall say unto them, When all of you have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And all of you shall eat it in every place, all of you and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='19'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='13'>"Whosoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifies not himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"This is the law, when a man dies in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And every open vessel, which has no covering bound upon it, is unclean."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And whosoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And the people find fault with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!"</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And why have all of you brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And wherefore have all of you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Take the rod, and gather you the assembly together, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak all of you unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock: so you shall give the congregation and their beasts drink."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, all of you rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he stroke the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the LORD spoke unto Moses and Aaron, Because all of you believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore all of you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus says your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='17'>"Let us pass, I pray you, through your country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your borders."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And Edom said unto him, You shall not pass by me, lest I come out against you with the sword."</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have all of you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against you; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And the LORD said unto Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks upon it, shall live."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies upon the border of Moab."</Verse>

			<Verse id='17'>"Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing all of you unto it:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"The princes dug the well, the nobles of the people dug it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='23'>"And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And Israel stroke him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof."</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the next day after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the very same day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the manna ceased on the next day after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite to him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What says my Lord unto his servant?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now Jericho was strictly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into yours hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And all of you shall compass the city, all you men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shall you do six days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day all of you shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when all of you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, All of you shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall all of you shout."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD has given you the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And all of you, in any way keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest all of you make yourselves accursed, when all of you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she has, as all of you swore unto her."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwells in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And the men of Ai stroke of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and stroke them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turns their backs before their enemies!"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall surround us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do unto your great name?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get you up; wherefore lie you thus upon your face?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except all of you destroy the accursed from among you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus says the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of you, O Israel: you can not stand before yours enemies, until all of you take away the accursed thing from among you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"In the morning therefore all of you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has: because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has wrought folly in Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? the LORD shall trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, all of you shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be all of you all ready:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And it shall be, when all of you have taken the city, that all of you shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall all of you do. See, I have commanded you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai."</Verse>

			<Verse id='13'>"And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their hidden attackers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knows not that there were hidden attackers in ambush against him behind the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into yours hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they stroke them, so that they let none of them remain or escape."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and stroke it with the edge of the sword."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."</Verse>

			<Verse id='29'>"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remains unto this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man has lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to know, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan."</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='7'>"And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lies before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah."</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."</Verse>

			<Verse id='12'>"And they said unto him, We are come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that all of you will not fall upon me yourselves."</Verse>

			<Verse id='6'>"And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray you, wherein your great strength lies, and wherewith you might be bound to afflict you."</Verse>

			<Verse id='13'>"And Delilah said unto Samson, Until now you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith you might be bound. And he said unto her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And she said unto him, How can you say, I love you, when yours heart is not with me? you have mocked me these three times, and have not told me wherein your great strength lies."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='18'>"And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he has showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him."</Verse>

			<Verse id='21'>"But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Nevertheless the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together in order to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."</Verse>

			<Verse id='33'>"And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the hidden attackers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And the LORD stroke Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the hidden attackers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"And the hidden attackers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the hidden attackers in wait drew themselves along, and stroke all the city with the edge of the sword."</Verse>

			<Verse id='39'>"And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle."</Verse>
			<Verse id='40'>"But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven."</Verse>
			<Verse id='41'>"And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='43'>"Thus they enclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease opposite to Gibeah toward the sunrising."</Verse>
			<Verse id='44'>"And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour."</Verse>
			<Verse id='45'>"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='46'>"So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour."</Verse>
			<Verse id='47'>"But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months."</Verse>
			<Verse id='48'>"And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and stroke them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons."</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah."</Verse>

			<Verse id='15'>"And she said, Behold, your sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return you after your sister in law."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And Ruth said, Implore me not to leave you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your people shall be my people, and your God my God:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz."</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house."</Verse>

			<Verse id='9'>"Let yours eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go you after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in yours eyes, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Boaz answered and said unto her, It has fully been showed me, all that you have done unto your mother in law since the death of yours husband: and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your nativity, and are come unto a people which you knew not in time past."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"The LORD recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to trust."</Verse>

			<Verse id='14'>"And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come you here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And her mother in law said unto her, Where have you gleaned to day? and where wrought you? blessed be he that did take knowledge of you. And she showed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, that they meet you not in any other field."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='3'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"And she said unto her, All that you says unto me I will do."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth yours handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over yours handmaid; for you are a near kinsman."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And he said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my daughter: for you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you followed not young men, whether poor or rich."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you require: for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman."</Verse>

			<Verse id='14'>"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Also he said, Bring the vail that you have upon you, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto your mother in law."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='4'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit all of you down here. And they sat down."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:"</Verse>

If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin mine own inheritance: redeem you my right to yourself; for I cannot redeem it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, in order to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for you. So he drew off his shoe."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, All of you are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: all of you are witnesses this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that has come into yours house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And let your house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give you of this young woman."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son."</Verse>

			<Verse id='15'>"Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, Nay; but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision."</Verse>

			<Verse id='11'>"It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be you of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the LORD has said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And Samuel said, When you were little in yours own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed you king over Israel?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And the LORD sent you on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Wherefore then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but did fly upon the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the LORD?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD your God in Gilgal."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"And Samuel said unto him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbour of yours, that is better than you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD your God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"Then said Samuel, Bring all of you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='16'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill yours horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint unto me him whom I name unto you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Come you peaceably?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD has not chosen these."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he comes here."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was rosy, and likewise of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Let our lord now command your servants, which are before you, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, which is with the sheep."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour bearer."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me; for he has found favour in my sight."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim."</Verse>

			<Verse id='22'>"And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And the men of Israel said, Have all of you seen this man that has come up? surely to defy Israel is he comes up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='39'>"And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='40'>"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a pouch; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."</Verse>
			<Verse id='41'>"And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and rosy, and of a fair countenance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='43'>"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."</Verse>
			<Verse id='44'>"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field."</Verse>
			<Verse id='45'>"Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied."</Verse>
			<Verse id='46'>"This day will the LORD deliver you into mine hand; and I will strike you, and take yours head from you; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='47'>"And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands."</Verse>
			<Verse id='48'>"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."</Verse>
			<Verse id='49'>"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and stroke the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='50'>"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and stroke the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David."</Verse>
			<Verse id='51'>"Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled."</Verse>
			<Verse id='52'>"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron."</Verse>
			<Verse id='53'>"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents."</Verse>

			<Verse id='9'>"And Jonathan said, Far be it from you: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon you, then would not I tell it you?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if your father answer you roughly?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto you, and show it you;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do you evil, then I will show it you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them; then come you: for there is peace to you, and no hurt; as the LORD lives."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way: for the LORD has sent you away."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And as concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between you and me for ever."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And it came to pass on the next day, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore comes not the son of Jesse to food, neither yesterday, nor to day?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in yours eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brethren. Therefore he comes not unto the king's table."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to yours own confusion, and unto the confusion of your mother's nakedness?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what has he done?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And Saul cast a javelin at him to strike him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."</Verse>
			<Verse id='39'>"But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter."</Verse>
			<Verse id='40'>"And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='41'>"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded."</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabouts I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Now therefore what is under yours hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Truthfully women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under yours hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scratch on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, all of you see the man is mad: wherefore then have all of you brought him to me?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men."</Verse>

			<Verse id='9'>"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."</Verse>

			<Verse id='17'>"And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me.

			<Verse id='1'>"Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors."</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto you, Behold, I will deliver yours enemy into yours hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good unto you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart stroke him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt."</Verse>

			<Verse id='11'>"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against you; yet you hunt my soul to take it."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran."</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='9'>"And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants these days that break away every man from his master."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And David said unto his men, Gird all of you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he has requited me evil for good."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisses against the wall."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let yours handmaid, I pray you, speak in yours audience, and hear the words of yours handmaid."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I yours handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, seeing the LORD has withheld you from coming to shed blood, and from avenging yourself with yours own hand, now let yours enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And now this blessing which yours handmaid has brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"I pray you, forgive the trespass of yours handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil has not been found in you all your days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"Yet a man has risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of yours enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you ruler over Israel;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"That this shall be no grief unto you, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that you have shed blood causeless, or that my lord has avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember yours handmaid."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent you this day to meet me:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And blessed be your advice, and blessed be you, which have kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel lives, which has kept me back from hurting you, except you had hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisses against the wall."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to yours house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and have accepted your person."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light."</Verse>

			<Verse id='10'>"Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."</Verse>

			<Verse id='16'>"And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe."</Verse>

			<Verse id='20'>"Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asahel? And he answered, I am."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: wherefore should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Nevertheless he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear stroke him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? know you not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, before you bid the people return from following their brethren?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And Joab said, As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='6'>"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore have you gone in unto my father's concubine?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day unto the house of Saul your father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD has sworn to David, even so I do to him;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel unto you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, All of you sought for David in times past to be king over you:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Now then do it: for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with you, and that you may reign over all that yours heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came unto you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and stroke him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, so fell you. And all the people wept again over him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner."</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"And the king said unto his servants, Know all of you not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='39'>"And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin."</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they stroke him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they stroke him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got them away through the plain all night."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul yours enemy, which sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah."</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And David said on that day, Whosoever gets up to the watercourse, and strikes the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward."</Verse>

			<Verse id='22'>"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand."</Verse>

			<Verse id='12'>"And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own food, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the travelling man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD lives, the man that has done this thing shall surely die:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus says the LORD God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto you such and such things."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Wherefore have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? you have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from yours house; because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of yours own house, and I will take your wives before yours eyes, and give them unto your neighbour, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"For you did it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Nevertheless, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto you shall surely die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.

			<Verse id='19'>"But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him."</Verse>

			<Verse id='29'>"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.

			<Verse id='3'>"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And he said unto him, Why are you, being the king's son, lean from day to day? will you not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And Jonadab said unto him, Lay you down on your bed, and make yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, say unto him, I pray you, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray you, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and dress him food."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of yours hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Nevertheless he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did unto me. But he would not hearken unto her."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Absalom her brother said unto her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry."</Verse>

			<Verse id='32'>"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as your servant said, so it is."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And the king said unto the woman, Go to yours house, and I will give charge concerning you."</Verse>

			<Verse id='14'>"For we must essentially die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid."</Verse>

			<Verse id='25'>"But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have your servants set my field on fire?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='15'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And Absalom said unto him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which has any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him reverence, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as all of you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all of you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore go you also with us? return to your place, and abide with the king: for you are a stranger, and also an exile."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us? seeing I go where I may, return you, and take back your brethren: mercy and truth be with you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will your servant be."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"But if he thus say, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good unto him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"Unto whom David said, If you pass on with me, then you shall be a burden unto me:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"But if you return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant until now, so will I now also be your servant: then may you for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that whatsoever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them all of you shall send unto me every thing that all of you can hear."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='16'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And the king said unto Ziba, What mean you by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, yours are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly plead to you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"The LORD has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose position you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son: and, behold, you are taken in your mischief, because you are a bloody man."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the king said, What have I to do with you, all of you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore have you done so?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came out of my bowels, seeks my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side opposite to him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? why went you not with your friend?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto your father's concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred of your father: then shall the hands of all that are with you be strong."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='17'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And I will bring back all the people unto you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke unto him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in yours own person."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Moreover, if he be got into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a maid servant went and told them; and they went and told king David."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; where they went down."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the tomb of his father."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched vegetables,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cattle, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='18'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"But the people answered, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now you are worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that you help us out of the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And the king said unto them, What seems you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, you saw him, and why did you not strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten shekels of silver, and a girdle."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and stroke Absalom, and slew him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And Joab said unto him, You shall not bear tidings this day, but you shall bear tidings another day: but this day you shall bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray you, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore will you run, my son, seeing that you have no tidings ready?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='26'>"And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the gate keeper, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings tidings."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And the watchman said, It seems to me that the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD your God, which has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD has avenged you this day of all them that rose up against you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='19'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, which this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"In that you love yours enemies, and hate your friends. For you have declared this day, that you regard neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto your servants: for I swear by the LORD, if you go not forth, there will not tarry one with you this night: and that will be worse unto you than all the evil that befell you from your youth until now."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom."</Verse>

			<Verse id='18'>"And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."</Verse>

			<Verse id='20'>"And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD your God accept you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat."</Verse>

			<Verse id='11'>"Wherefore Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith does reign, and David our lord knows it not?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='22'>"And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, has he not called."</Verse>

			<Verse id='28'>"Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And the king swore, and said, As the LORD lives, that has redeemed my soul out of all distress,"</Verse>

			<Verse id='38'>"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon."</Verse>

			<Verse id='41'>"And Adonijah and all the guest that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for you are a valiant man, and bring good tidings."</Verse>

			<Verse id='47'>"And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='48'>"And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which has given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='49'>"And all the guest that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way."</Verse>

			<Verse id='53'>"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to yours house."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='2'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,"</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and anywhere you turn yourself:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Do therefore according to your wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And, behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for you are a wise man, and know what you ought to do unto him; but his hoar head bring you down to the grave with blood."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly."</Verse>

			<Verse id='16'>"And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And he said, Speak, I pray you, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say you nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you unto the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Then she said, I desire one small petition of you; I pray you, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say you nay."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother to wife."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"Now therefore, as the LORD lives, which has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, unto yours own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bare the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And the king said unto him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to know, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build you an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any where."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"For it shall be, that on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be upon yours own head."</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='39'>"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath."</Verse>
			<Verse id='40'>"And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath."</Verse>
			<Verse id='41'>"And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again."</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make you to swear by the LORD, and protested unto you, saying, Know for a certain, on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, that you shall surely die? and you said unto me, The word that I have heard is good."</Verse>
			<Verse id='43'>"Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged you with?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='44'>"The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which yours heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness upon yours own head;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='31'>"For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springs out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='5'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"You know how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto David my father, saying, Your son, whom I will set upon your throne in your room, he shall build an house unto my name."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and unto you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which has given unto David a wise son over this great people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which you sent to me for: and I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in rafts unto the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and you shall receive them: and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the Gibalites also: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='6'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And for the house he made windows of narrow lights."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Concerning this house which you are in building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with you, which I spoke unto David your father:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"So Solomon built the house, and finished it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And the oracle in the front part was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"And he overlaid the cherubims with gold."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='7'>
			<Verse id='1'>"But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, opposite to the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supporters: under the vessel that holds water were supporters molten, at the side of every addition."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their rims, and their spokes, were all molten."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"And there were four supporters to the four corners of one base: and the supporters were of the very base itself."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size."</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"Then made he ten lavers of brass: one vessel that holds water contained forty baths: and every vessel that holds water was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one vessel that holds water."</Verse>
			<Verse id='39'>"And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward opposite to the south."</Verse>
			<Verse id='40'>"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='41'>"The two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='43'>"And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='44'>"And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='45'>"And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass."</Verse>
			<Verse id='46'>"In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan."</Verse>
			<Verse id='47'>"And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out."</Verse>
			<Verse id='48'>"And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the showbread was,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='49'>"And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='50'>"And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to know, of the temple."</Verse>
			<Verse id='51'>"So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='8'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion."</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims."</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt."</Verse>

			<Verse id='64'>"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and food offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and food offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings."</Verse>
			<Verse id='65'>"And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days."</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that all of you go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Now therefore thus says the LORD, You shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah departed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are all of you now turned back?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, return unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus says the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you send to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke unto him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your sight."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And he said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Forasmuch as you have sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his position in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='2'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel."</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold all of you your peace."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray you, here; for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they two went on."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view far off: and they two stood by Jordan."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and stroke the waters, and they were divided here and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so unto you; but if not, it shall not be so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and stroke the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted here and thither: and Elisha went over."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master: lest possibly the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, All of you shall not send."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is nil, and the ground barren."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='3'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not from it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And he said, Thus says the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches."</Verse>

			<Verse id='18'>"And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And all of you shall strike every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And it came to pass in the morning, when the food offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and stroke the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; nevertheless the slingers went about it, and stroke it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his position, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='4'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen."</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And it fell upon a certain day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Let us make a little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in thither."</Verse>

			<Verse id='14'>"And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she has no child, and her husband is old."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper."</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, All of you shall not do this thing."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn all of you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Wherefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom all of you brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"Nevertheless every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the low of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, All of you shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall all of you fear, and him shall all of you worship, and to him shall all of you do sacrifice."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, all of you shall observe to do for evermore; and all of you shall not fear other gods."</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"And the covenant that I have made with you all of you shall not forget; neither shall all of you fear other gods."</Verse>
			<Verse id='39'>"But the LORD your God all of you shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies."</Verse>
			<Verse id='40'>"Nevertheless they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner."</Verse>
			<Verse id='41'>"So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign."</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses."</Verse>

			<Verse id='11'>"And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='13'>"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them."</Verse>

			<Verse id='18'>"And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder."</Verse>

			<Verse id='27'>"But Rabshakeh said unto them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='31'>"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat all of you every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink all of you every one the waters of his cistern:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that all of you may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"Has any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='36'>"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='19'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD."</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"It may be the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard: wherefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that are left."</Verse>

			<Verse id='23'>"By your messengers you have reproached the LORD, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"Have you not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"But I know your abode, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"Because your rage against me and your tumult has come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And this shall be a sign unto you, All of you shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow all of you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader."</Verse>

			<Verse id='11'>"And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite."</Verse>

			<Verse id='13'>"And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley."</Verse>

			<Verse id='13'>"For because all of you did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy."</Verse>

			<Verse id='25'>"So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD."</Verse>

			<Verse id='16'>"And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces."</Verse>

			<Verse id='23'>"And Ornan said unto David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the food offering; I give it all."</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"Thus says the LORD, All of you shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and brings forth twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)"</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='12'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus says the LORD, All of you have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his position."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='13'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, you Jeroboam, and all Israel;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Ought all of you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, has risen up, and has rebelled against his lord."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And now all of you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and all of you be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Have all of you not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but all of you have forsaken him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight all of you not against the LORD God of your fathers; for all of you shall not prosper."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God stroke Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and brings forth twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='14'>
			<Verse id='1'>"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his position. In his days the land was quiet ten years."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with you to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on you, and in your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let no man prevail against you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"So the LORD stroke the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And they stroke all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"They stroke also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='15'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear all of you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while all of you be with him; and if all of you seek him, he will be found of you; but if all of you forsake him, he will forsake you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Now for a long season Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Be all of you strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And they swore unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='16'>
			<Verse id='1'>"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"There is a league between me and you, as there was between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they stroke Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of yours hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because you did rely on the LORD, he delivered them into yours hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"For the eyes of the LORD run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly: therefore from henceforth you shall have wars."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='17'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his position, and strengthened himself against Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand."</Verse>

			<Verse id='16'>"And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='18'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab."</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says the LORD, With these you shall push Syria until they be consumed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let your word therefore, I pray you, be like one of their's, and speak you good."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, even what my God says, that will I speak."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go all of you up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, You shall entice him, and you shall also prevail: go out, and do even so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil against you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and stroke Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto you?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"Then the king of Israel said, Take all of you Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"And say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace."</Verse>

			<Verse id='28'>"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead."</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put you on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight all of you not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And a certain man drew a bow at random, and stroke the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn yours hand, that you may carry me out of the host; for I am wounded."</Verse>

			<Verse id='6'>"He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver."</Verse>

			<Verse id='19'>"You says, Lo, you have smitten the Edomites; and yours heart lifts you up to boast: abide now at home; why should you meddle to yours hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='15'>"Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came out of his own bowels slew him there with the sword."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth."</Verse>

			<Verse id='25'>"But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='32'>"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchers of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his position."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And prayed unto him: and he was implored of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"His prayer also, and how God was implored of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his position."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his position."</Verse>

			<Verse id='2'>"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and scattered it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem."</Verse>

			<Verse id='9'>"And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of music."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses."</Verse>

			<Verse id='18'>"Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And she answered them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Tell all of you the man that sent you to me,"</Verse>

			<Verse id='26'>"And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall all of you say unto him, Thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which you have heard;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='28'>"Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall yours eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again."</Verse>

			<Verse id='30'>"And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month."</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,"</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen."</Verse>

			<Verse id='11'>"And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings cook they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah."</Verse>

			<Verse id='23'>"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='5'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, All of you exact interest, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will all of you even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Also I said, It is not good that all of you do: ought all of you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this interest."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive yards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that all of you exact of them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you says. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performs not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='6'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause you build the wall, that you may be their king, according to these words."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as you says, but you feign them out of yours own heart."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yea, in the night will they come to slay you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"My God, think you upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='7'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be opposite to his house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,"</Verse>

		<Chapter id='8'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be all of you sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength."</Verse>

			<Verse id='17'>"And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sack clothes, and earth upon them."</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"And found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And did see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red sea;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you knew that they dealt proudly against them. So did you get you a name, as it is this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And you did divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors you threw into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Moreover you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"You came down also upon mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And made known unto them your holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses your servant:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to your commandments,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsook them not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Yet you in your manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"You gave also your good spirit to instruct them, and withheld not your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Yea, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Moreover you gave them kingdoms and nations, and did divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Their children also multiplied you as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land, concerning which you had promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells dug, vineyards, and olive yards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their backs, and slew your prophets which testified against them to turn them to you, and they wrought great provocations."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"But after they had rest, they did evil again before you: therefore left you them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='29'>"And testified against them, that you might bring them again unto your law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto your commandments, but sinned against your judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."</Verse>
			<Verse id='30'>"Yet many years did you forbear them, and testified against them by your spirit in your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the people of the lands."</Verse>
			<Verse id='31'>"Nevertheless for your great mercies' sake you did not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keep covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before you, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day."</Verse>

			<Verse id='20'>"So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice."</Verse>

			<Verse id='12'>"Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to know, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)"</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like when she was brought up with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus."</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='3'>
			<Verse id='1'>"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why trangress you the king's commandment?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had showed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='4'>
			<Verse id='1'>"When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And in every province, anywhere the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Again Esther spoke unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And they told to Mordecai Esther's words."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with yourself that you shall escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"For if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but you and your father's house shall be destroyed: and who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast all of you for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='5'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, opposite to the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, opposite to the gate of the house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Then said the king unto her, What will you, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be even given you to the half of the kingdom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."</Verse>

			<Verse id='9'>"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak you unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go you in merrily with the king unto the banquet.

			<Verse id='7'>"And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honour,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Let the royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='13'>"And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him.

			<Verse id='8'>"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was.

			<Verse id='25'>"But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."</Verse>

			<Verse id='14'>"Now he has not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches."</Verse>

			<Verse id='17'>"I said, I will answer also my part, I also will show mine opinion."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"Furthermore Elihu answered and said,"</Verse>

			<Verse id='24'>"He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their position."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='29'>"When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='15'>"He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness."</Verse>

			<Verse id='19'>"Yea, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Behold, he stroke the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Therefore the LORD heard this, and was angry: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven."</Verse>

			<Verse id='31'>"The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and stroke down the chosen men of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='32'>"For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works."</Verse>
			<Verse id='33'>"Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer."</Verse>
			<Verse id='36'>"Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues."</Verse>
			<Verse id='37'>"For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant."</Verse>
			<Verse id='38'>"But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath."</Verse>
			<Verse id='39'>"For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passes away, and comes not again."</Verse>
			<Verse id='40'>"How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!"</Verse>
			<Verse id='41'>"Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel."</Verse>
			<Verse id='42'>"They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy."</Verse>
			<Verse id='43'>"How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan."</Verse>
			<Verse id='44'>"And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink."</Verse>
			<Verse id='45'>"He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='46'>"He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust."</Verse>
			<Verse id='47'>"He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost."</Verse>
			<Verse id='48'>"He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts."</Verse>
			<Verse id='49'>"He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='50'>"He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='51'>"And stroke all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='52'>"But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock."</Verse>
			<Verse id='53'>"And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies."</Verse>
			<Verse id='54'>"And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased."</Verse>
			<Verse id='55'>"He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents."</Verse>
			<Verse id='56'>"Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='57'>"But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow."</Verse>
			<Verse id='58'>"For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images."</Verse>
			<Verse id='59'>"When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='60'>"So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='61'>"And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='62'>"He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was angry with his inheritance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='63'>"The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage."</Verse>
			<Verse id='64'>"Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation."</Verse>
			<Verse id='65'>"Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine."</Verse>
			<Verse id='66'>"And he stroke his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach."</Verse>
			<Verse id='67'>"Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='68'>"But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved."</Verse>
			<Verse id='69'>"And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he has established for ever."</Verse>
			<Verse id='70'>"He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='71'>"From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance."</Verse>
			<Verse id='72'>"So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore do you prophesy, and say, Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='8'>"So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison."</Verse>

			<Verse id='1'>"And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall all of you say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Thus says the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"For though all of you had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and stroke him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that all of you have put me in prison?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"Therefore hear now, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray you, be accepted before you; that you cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='38'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"Thus says the LORD, He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Thus says the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Therefore the princes said unto the king, We plead to you, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from behind thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under yours armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, will you not hearken unto me?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"So Zedekiah the king swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD lives, that made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men that seek your life."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If you will assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and yours house:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I plead to you, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto you: so it shall be well unto you, and your soul shall live."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD has showed me:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Your friends have set you on, and have prevailed against you: your feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"So they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans: and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come unto you, and say unto you, Declare unto us now what you have said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said unto you:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"Then you shall say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived."</Verse>
			<Verse id='28'>"So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='39'>
			<Verse id='1'>"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"But I will deliver you in that day, says the LORD: and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey unto you: because you have put your trust in me, says the LORD."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='40'>
			<Verse id='1'>"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD your God has pronounced this evil upon this place."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Now the LORD has brought it, and done according as he has said: because all of you have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come upon you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which were upon yours hand. If it seem good unto you to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto you: but if it seem ill unto you to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before you: where it seems good and convenient for you to go, thither go."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go where ever it seems convenient unto you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but all of you, gather all of you wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that all of you have taken."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Even all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And said unto him, Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay you? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray you, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay you, that all the Jews which are gathered unto you should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing: for you speak falsely of Ishmael."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='41'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and stroke Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he ceased, and slew them not among their brethren."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land."</Verse>
		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='42'>
			<Verse id='1'>"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we plead to you, our supplication be accepted before you, and pray for us unto the LORD your God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as yours eyes do behold us:)"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"That the LORD your God may show us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD your God shall send you to us."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And said unto them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom all of you sent me to present your supplication before him;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"If all of you will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom all of you are afraid; be not afraid of him, says the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And I will show mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"But if all of you say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, all of you remnant of Judah; Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If all of you wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which all of you feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof all of you were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there all of you shall die."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury has been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when all of you shall enter into Egypt: and all of you shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and all of you shall see this place no more."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"The LORD has said concerning you, O all of you remnant of Judah; Go all of you not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"For all of you dissembled in your hearts, when all of you sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it."</Verse>

		<Chapter id='43'>
			<Verse id='1'>"And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='2'>"Then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, You speak falsely: the LORD our God has not sent you to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='3'>"But Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, in order to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah."</Verse>

			<Verse id='7'>"So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,"</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"Take great stones in yours hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And say unto them, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them."</Verse>

		</Chapter>
		<Chapter id='44'>
			<Verse id='1'>"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,"</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, all of you, nor your fathers."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"Nevertheless I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"Therefore now thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit all of you this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and nursing infant, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;"</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire setting itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass."</Verse>

			<Verse id='12'>"And they went every one straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning."</Verse>

			<Verse id='5'>"And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='9'>"Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the children which are of your sort? then shall all of you make me endanger my head to the king."</Verse>

			<Verse id='16'>"Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven."</Verse>

			<Verse id='42'>"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken."</Verse>
			<Verse id='43'>"And whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."</Verse>
			<Verse id='44'>"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever."</Verse>

			<Verse id='12'>"The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:"</Verse>

			<Verse id='33'>"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws."</Verse>
			<Verse id='34'>"And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:"</Verse>
			<Verse id='35'>"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What do you?"</Verse>

			<Verse id='3'>"And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another."</Verse>
			<Verse id='4'>"The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him."</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me."</Verse>
			<Verse id='16'>"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things."</Verse>
			<Verse id='17'>"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever."</Verse>
			<Verse id='19'>"Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='20'>"And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows."</Verse>
			<Verse id='21'>"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;"</Verse>
			<Verse id='22'>"Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."</Verse>
			<Verse id='23'>"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."</Verse>
			<Verse id='24'>"And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings."</Verse>
			<Verse id='25'>"And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."</Verse>
			<Verse id='26'>"But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end."</Verse>
			<Verse id='27'>"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."</Verse>

			<Verse id='4'>"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great."</Verse>
			<Verse id='5'>"And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."</Verse>
			<Verse id='6'>"And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power."</Verse>
			<Verse id='7'>"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and stroke the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand."</Verse>
			<Verse id='8'>"Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."</Verse>
			<Verse id='9'>"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land."</Verse>
			<Verse id='10'>"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them."</Verse>
			<Verse id='11'>"Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down."</Verse>
			<Verse id='12'>"And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered."</Verse>
			<Verse id='13'>"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?"</Verse>
			<Verse id='14'>"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."</Verse>
			<Verse id='15'>"And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man."</Verse>

			<Verse id='17'>"So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision."</Verse>
			<Verse id='18'>"Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright."</Verse>
